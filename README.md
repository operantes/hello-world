# hello-world
Following through the newbee's guide.
I come from coding background of already almost +20 years ago, where the version control tools I used were RCD, for file-level version control, and CVS, for distribution level version control
Based on what I've read so far, I understand that Git and Github follow a partly different paradigm, mainly in terms of what is the flow followed for merging a branch with the main branchtrunk at any given time. 
Now referencing a GitHub user in my comment: "@operantes check this out"
